                                    for Windows, OS X, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 in August 2012, while the Linux version was released in 2014. The game pits two teams against each other: the Terrorists and the CounterTerrorists. Both sides are tasked
                                    with eliminating the other while also completing separate objectives. The Terrorists, depending on the game mode, must either plant the bomb or defend the hostages, while the Counter-Terrorists must either prevent the
                                    bomb from being planted, defuse the bomb, or rescue the hostages.
